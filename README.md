# The-8-Queen-Puzzle

Remember the 8-queens puzzle. It is a chess problem of placing eight queens on an 8×8 chessboard
so that no two queens cross each other, thus a solution requires that no two queens share the same
row, column, or diagonal. The 8-queens puzzle is an example of the more general n-queens puzzle of
placing n non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural numbers
n with the exception of n = 2 and n = 3.

Files to Edit and Submit: You will fill in the section of GA.py (comments are
provided on where to add which functionality) for the assignment. You should
submit this file with your code and comments.
To implement the code for local search based on Genetic Algorithm.

Question : Implement GA 
● Solve the n-queen problem using Genetic Algorithm.
● Take 5 different values for the hyperparameters viz. number of queens, population size,
crossover probability and mutation probability and observe the changes in the best fitness
value in the population across different generations for each combination of number of queens,
crossover and mutation probability.
(So there should be 5 outputs relating to 5 different setting of hyperparameters, each
hyperparameter should be varied)
